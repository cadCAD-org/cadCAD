***cadCAD*** is a Python package that assists in the processes of designing, testing and validating complex systems 
through simulation, with support for Monte Carlo methods, A/B testing and parameter sweeping. 

# Getting Started
## 1. Install cadCAD
cadCAD requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
cadCAD can be installed using Python’s package manager, [pip](https://pypi.org/project/cadCAD/)
```bash
pip install cadCAD
```
## 2. Learn the basics
Check out our tutorials (available both as [Jupyter Notebooks](tutorials) and 
[videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJEiYHRWA9g&list=PLmWm8ksQq4YKtdRV-SoinhV6LbQMgX1we)) to familiarize yourself 
with some system modelling concepts and cadCAD terminology. Alternatively, go straight to the 
[documentation](documentation).

## 3. Connect
Find other cadCAD users at our [Discourse](https://community.cadcad.org/). We are a small but rapidly growing community.
