***cadCAD*** is a Python package that assists in the processes of designing, testing and validating complex systems 
through simulation, with support for Monte Carlo methods, A/B testing and parameter sweeping. 

# Getting Started


#### Change Log: [ver. 0.4.23](CHANGELOG.md)

[Previous Stable Release (No Longer Supported)](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/cadCAD/tree/b9cc6b2e4af15d6361d60d6ec059246ab8fbf6da)

## 0. Pre-installation Virtual Environments with [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (Optional):
If you wish to create an easy to use virtual environment to install cadCAD inside of, please use the built in `venv` package.

***Create** a virtual environment:*
```bash
$ python3 -m venv ~/cadcad
```

***Activate** an existing virtual environment:*
```bash
$ source ~/cadcad/bin/activate
(cadcad) $
```

***Deactivate** virtual environment:*
```bash
(cadcad) $ deactivate
$
```

## 1. Installation: 
Requires [>= Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 

**Option A: Install Using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/cadCAD/)** 
```bash
$ pip3 install cadCAD
```

**Option B:** Build From Source
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
$ pip3 install dist/*.whl
```

**Option C: Using [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/)**
1. Run `curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh` or install Nix via system package manager
2. Run `nix-shell` to enter into a development environment, `nix-build` to build project from source, and 
`nix-env -if default.nix` to install

The above steps will enter you into a Nix development environment, with all package requirements for development of and 
with cadCAD. 

This works with just about all Unix systems as well as MacOS, for pure reproducible builds that don't 
affect your local environment.

## 2. Documentation:
* [Simulation Configuration](documentation/README.md)
* [Simulation Execution](documentation/Simulation_Execution.md)
* [Policy Aggregation](documentation/Policy_Aggregation.md)
* [Parameter Sweep](documentation/System_Model_Parameter_Sweep.md)
* [Display System Model Configurations](documentation/System_Configuration.md)
