    "## What is cadCAD?\n",
    "cadCAD is a Python library that assists in the processes of designing, testing and validating complex systems through simulation. At its core, cadCAD is a differential games engine that supports parameter sweeping and Monte Carlo analyses and can be easily integrated with other scientific computing Python modules and data science workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "At [BlockScience](http://bit.ly/github_articles_M_1), we've been using cadCAD as a tool for [Token Engineering](https://medium.com/block-science/on-the-practice-of-token-engineering-part-i-c2cc2434e727) - the design of self-organizing systems enabled through cryptographic peer-to-peer networks. But cadCAD can simulate any system that can be described as state variables that evolve over time according to a set of equations. This series of articles will go over the basic concepts of cadCAD and the 'language' in which a system must be described in order for it to be interpretable by the library. This article will cover the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook#create=true&language=python3) is a very useful tool for running cadCAD models, for this tutorial, or any other, just add `!pip install cadCAD` as the first line and you will have an easy sandbox for playing with cadCAD.\n",

    "__The robot and the marbles__  \n",
    "* Picture a box (`box_A`) with ten marbles in it; an empty box (`box_B`) next to the first one; and a robot arm capable of taking a marble from any one of the boxes and dropping it into the other one. \n",
    "* The robot is programmed to take one marble at a time from the box containing the largest number of marbles and drop it in the other box. It repeats that process until the boxes contain an equal number of marbles.  \n",

    "## State Variables\n",
    ">A state variable is one of the set of variables that are used to describe the mathematical \"state\" of a dynamical system. Intuitively, the state of a system describes enough about the system to determine its future behaviour in the absence of any external forces affecting the system. [_(source: Wikipedia)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "cadCAD can handle state variables of any Python data type, including custom classes. It is up to the user of cadCAD to determine the state variables needed to sufficiently accurately describe the system they are interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could describe the simple system in our example with only two state variables: the number of marbles in `box_A` and in `box_B`. These are not the only two variables that describe the system, of course. Things like the position of the robot arm in space or its temperature also qualify as \"variables that describe the state of the system\". But if we assume those variables have no impact on the behavior of the system (as implied by the description) we can safely disregard them.\n",
    "\n",
    "cadCAD expects state variables to be passed to it as a Python `dict` where the `dict_keys` are the __names of the \n",
    "variables__ and the `dict_values` are their __initial values__."

    "# Timestep\n",
    "Computer simulations run in discrete time:\n",
    ">Discrete time views values of variables as occurring at distinct, separate \"points in time\", or equivalently as being unchanged throughout each non-zero region of time (\"time period\")—that is, time is viewed as a discrete variable. Thus a non-time variable jumps from one value to another as time moves from one time period to the next. This view of time corresponds to a digital clock that gives a fixed reading of 10:37 for a while, and then jumps to a new fixed reading of 10:38, etc. [_(source: Wikipedia)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_time_and_continuous_time)\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of Timestep in cadCAD refers to a discrete unit of time. cadCAD increments a \"time counter\", and at each step it updates the state variables according to the equations that describe the system. If time itself is a state variable that the user is interested in keeping track of, they may specify a state update function that models the passing of time. We'll cover that scenario in an upcoming article. For the moment, it suffices to define that the robot acts once per timestep.\n",
    "# State Update Functions\n",
    "State Update Functions are Python functions that represent the equations according to which the state variables change over time. Each state update function must return a tuple containing the name of the state variable being updated and its new value. The general structure of a state update function is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function(params, step, sL, s, _input):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    y = ...\n",
    "    x = ...\n",
    "    return (y, x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "State update functions can read the current state of the system from argument `s`. We'll ignore the other arguments for now. `s` is a Python `dict` where the `dict_keys` are the __names of the variables__ and the `dict_values` are their __current values__. With this, we can define the state update functions for variables `box_A` and `box_B`."
